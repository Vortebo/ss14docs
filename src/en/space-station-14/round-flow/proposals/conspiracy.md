## Overview

A very short, maybe three sentence summary of what this proposal is about. A high level "overview" or "what this adds".
A new team antagonist that encourages non-violent, stealth-y, social gameplay in order to suceed. Conspiracy designates several players as conspirators who must work together to accomplish a series of increasingly difficult tasks. Conspirators and crew alike are made to operate in an initially low-information environment and must use social deduction to work out who they can trust.

## Background

Summarize any information that is needed to contextualize the proposed changes, e.g. the current state of the game.

Also link any relevant discussions on Discord, GitHub, or HackMD that are relevant to the proposal.

## Features to be added

Give a description of what game mechanics you would like to add or change. This should be a general overview, with enough details on critical design points that someone can directly implement the feature from this design document. Exact numbers for game balance however are not necessary, as these can be adjusted later either during development or after it has been implemented, but mention *what* will have to be balanced and what needs to be considered when doing so.

**Conspirator Goals**

The conspirators must complete a series of tasks and then escape to centcomm alive and unrestrained. Major victory when that happens. Minor victories when at least one level two task is completed and/or some number of conspirators make it to centcomm. Crew victory when every conspirator is dead or detained. Tasks come in (three?) difficulties. Complete (three?) level one tasks to move to level two. Two levels twos to level three. X level three to finish the series.

Level 1  (explicitly requires every conspirator to participate, to make sure people come together)

- Everybody hugs the captain (3x times?)
- Graffitti [word] outside [department]. Everyone must contribute one letter
- Everybody must possess X number of [item]
  - Items could include medkits, 
- ?

Level 2
- Ine
- to
- free?

Here's where I just list a bunch of ideas I've had and like I dunno how many difficulty levels there will be so like
Switch/rename beacons
Move [object] from [department A] to [department B]
Stockpile X number of [item]
Weld crewmembers [person 1] - [person ?3?] in the same closet
  Space the closet
Everybody eats one of the captain's organs
50% of hallways must be covered in liquid
Everyone has all access

## Game Design Rationale

Part of the goal is to have a slower-burn antagonist, one that has less potential for sudden jumps in chaos. This way crew as a whole can like do their jobs n stuff? Detective? Idk. Words are hard. Like, it should eventually get chaotic, but in a more controlled way. Also, going for paranoia.
Want to incentivize antagonists to do as little damage as possible so they can complete every task. Should be hard to actually get escape shuttle called while still maintaining cover.

Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../space-station-14/core-design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?
- What makes this feature enjoyable or rewarding for players?
- Does it introduce meaningful choices, risk vs. reward, or new strategies?
- How does it enhance player cooperation, competition, or emergent gameplay?
- If the feature is a new antagonist, how does it fit into the corresponding [design pillars](../space-station-14/round-flow/antagonists.md)?

## Roundflow & Player interaction

Consider addressing:
- At what point in the round does the feature come into play? Does it happen every round? How does it affect the round pace?
- How do you wish for players to interact with your feature and how should they not interact with it? How is this mechanically enforced?
- Which department will interact with the feature? How does the feature fit into the [design document](../space-station-14/departments.md) for that department?

## Administrative & Server Rule Impact (if applicable)

- Does this feature introduce any new rule enforcement challenges or additional workload for admins?
- Could this feature increase the likelihood of griefing, rule-breaking, or player disputes?
- How are the rules enforced mechanically by way the feature will be implemented?

# Technical Considerations

- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
